Note for MS Windows builds: that to build the DirectInput dependent code you must have the DirectX SDK installed on your system.
Such external binary dependencies are managed via the ModuleInfo.xml under /dependencies/external

Note that for some of the dependencies you need to Windows SDK installed. Said SDK needs to be of the correct recent version to avoid build issues.
Incorrect older SDKs on Windows can cause build issues due to certain APIs not being available because of NTDDI_VERSION based exclusions.
