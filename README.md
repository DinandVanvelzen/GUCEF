# GUCEF

This is the main mono-repo for the Galaxy Unlimited Platform.
The software contained herein is a collection of libraries and derived services and applications all fairly generic in nature.
The overarching purpose of these libraries is to act as a C++ toolchest with which to rapidly develop applications and services.
Some such tools/applications/services are included in the same mono-repo as well.

Note that the main platform modules intentionally do not mandate newer versions of C++ to allow them to be used in situations where no modern compiler is available. 
Any use of newer language features tends to be handled via macros for that reason such that the code can still compile using older compilers.

## About the name
GUCEF stood for "Galaxy Unlimited Client Engine Framework" at one time. It was part of a multi-tier stack that had independent GUCE and GU software stack tiers.
GUCE stood for "Galaxy Unlimited Client Engine".
GUC stood for "Galaxy Unlimited Client".
GU is still the abbreviation for "Galaxy Unlimited".
At this time GUCEF and GUCE have merged together and some parts of GUC and GU have been incorporated as well.
Instead of being client-side focused at lot of the new development has focused on supporting services and generally back end development.

## A bit of history
Throughout the years various codebases were created and lessons learned  by the author. Slowly but surely a common core of code emerged that started growing organically.
The original common core code base was partially lost a couple times due to data rentention issues and youngster backup practices, further constrained by a lack of financial resources.
Various repositories were merged together, combining various partial backups to create the first version of the GUCEF repo. This first version found its public home on SourceForce.
Originally CVS was used as the version control system, followed by SVN and later followed by Git. When the move to Git was contemplated a new home for the open source repo was also considered.
Due to growing open-source community popularity GitHub won the day as the new home for GUCEF and some related repos where it remains today.

## About the author
Aside from the dependencies almost all code in this repository was written by Dinand Vanvelzen. 
Dinand started programming as a child during the 1980s, writing assembly code for the MSX which was a Philips designed take on a PC concept.
Later on during the 1990s RAD programming principles became the new love afair via Borland Delphi followed by Borland C++ Builder.
At this juncture the author had embarked upon professsional education in the dark arts of software engineering. 
A dual strategy was persued between application programming and back-end/lower-level programming which were distinct degrees at the time.
During this time the codebase you find in this repository continued to grow and evolve as concepts blended and evolved.
During the 2000s the author's main focus was on visualization, mostly 3D graphics both professsionally and as an intellectual curiosity making its way into this repository.
Migration to the United States and starting a family slowed new development to a trickle for a good number of years before beginning to pick back up once the personal situation stabilized.
It is during this phase that youthful idealism started to give way to pragmatism. Professionally the interventional heathcare domain gave way to enterprise healthcare which in turn later gave way to the financial sector.
Subsequent new development has pragmatically focused on common needs in the author's professional life with the incidental oddball projects mixed in as a means to an end.

## mono-repo breakdown
- /platform : this has the main platform modules having both concrete portable functionality and interfaces for utilizing additional functionality via plugins
- /plugins : this has various plugins that can optionally be used to extend platform capabilities
- /projects : this has scripts and the like for generating build projects
- /common/bin : this has binary output of projects
- /dependencies : As the name suggests this folder has the various dependency libraries used by plugins, never by platform libraries directly.
- /tests : As the name suggests, this hold some dedicated test code

## How to generate a project for my IDE
The main method through which IDE project/solution files are supported is via CMake. 
The CMake files themselves are almost all auto-generated via a tool included in this repo called 'ProjectGenerator'.
ProjectGenerator performs an analysis of the files in the repo with minimal ModuleInfo.xml files to identify modules, from there it derives all needed paths and generates the needed files.
This same tool can output middleware files for other toolchains as well, not just CMake. 
There are also premake 4 and premake 5 and android make files included but they are not updated as frequently at the moment so your milage will vary on those.

In most cases you want to go to /projects/CMake first to generate the relevant IDE files.
In that folder you will see various scripts with long names. At some point this will be refactored per the TODO list but for now the scheme is as follows:

As an example you have a script file like 'RunCMake_Shared_CodeBlocks_Unix_Debug_pubsub2pubsub.sh' 
- RunCMake_ : This first segment is just to set it apart from other files in the folder for historical reasons, ignore.
- Shared_ : This segment is mostly related to CMake where the default module build method passed will be 'dynamic' (dll/so) vs static (.lib/.a)
- CodeBlocks_ : This segment has the name of the IDE for which you wish to generate project files, in this example the Code Blocks IDE
- Unix_ : This segment denotes the target platform. Some IDEs support multiple target platforms.
- Debug_ : This segment may not be present for all scripts, it depends on the capabilities of the generator. For some generators the project files themselves need to be created from the start for either debug or release builds. This is not needed in the case of say Visual Studio
- pubsub2pubsub.sh : This segment denotes the main target of the logical view on the entire mono-repo. In this case the service pubsub2pubsub.

In other words the format is:
'RunCMake_Shared/Static_IDE to use_OS Target_Debug/Release_Target name.Executable script extension' 

On Windows when you run the above script and similar it will also trigger a run of the ProjectGenerator.
This is merely intended to make the flow more fool-proof since usually the commited CMake files are already up-to-date and thus this step can usually be x-ed out and skipped.
Following this potential step CMake is invoked to take care of the generation of the build files.
Such files are writting to  /common/bin. This repo follows the thinking that temporary output files should not be co-mingled with code.
If you get into trouble for whatever reason with stale/bad output files (disk issue?) one can always just delete the entire folder structure under /common/bin
